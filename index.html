            <p class="phrase-info">Hyperspace was an alternate dimension that could only be reached by traveling at or
                faster than the speed of light. Hyperdrives enabled starships to travel through hyperspace lanes across
                great distances, enabling travel and exploration throughout the galaxy</p>

            <p class="phrase-info">The lightsaber, also referred to as a laser sword by those who were unfamiliar with
                it, was a weapon usually used by the Jedi, the Sith, and other Force-sensitives. Lightsabers consisted

            <p class="phrase-info">The Galactic Empire ruled for years through fear, intimidation, and tyranny. With a
                mighty military force including stormtroopers, spy technology like probe droids, and the

            <p class="phrase-info">The Rebel Alliance (also known as the Republic) stood against the evil of the
                Galactic Empire, never backing down despite overwhelming odds. Formed from resistance movements that
                arose during the Clone Wars, the Rebellion worked in secret for decades to overthrow the Emperor and
                restore democracy to the galaxy. </p>

            <p class="phrase-info">The Force is a mysterious energy field created by life that binds the galaxy
                together. Harnessing the power of the Force gives the Jedi, the Sith, and others sensitive to this
                spiritual energy extraordinary abilities, such as levitating objects, tricking minds, and seeing things
                before they happen</p>

            <p class="phrase-info">The dark side of the Force was defined as anger, fear, aggression and a lust for
                power. It was stated that the Sith referred to the dark side as "dark" because it was secretive. The
                Sith kept their knowledge and identities secret because they believed it would make it easier for them
                to impose order.</p>
